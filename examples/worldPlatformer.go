			// Player's Shape (which is also a rectangular ConvexPolygon).

				// underneath the Player. This would keep the player from getting "stuck" when walking up a ramp into the top of a solid block, if there weren't
				// a landing at the top and bottom of the ramp.

				// We use 8 here for the Y-delta so that we can easily see if you're running down the ramp (in which case you're probably in the air as you
				// move faster than you can fall in this example). This way we can maintain contact so you can always jump while running down a ramp. We only
				// continue with coming into contact with the ramp as long as you're not moving upwards (i.e. jumping).

					// Minimum Translation Vector, to move out of contact.

					// Here, we use ContactSet.TopmostPoint() to get the top-most contact point as an indicator of where

			// Because there's a moving floating platform, we use Collision.ContactWithObject() to ensure the player comes into contact
